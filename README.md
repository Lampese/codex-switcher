<h1 align="center">Codex Switcher</h1>

<p align="center">
  A Desktop Application for Managing Multiple OpenAI <a href="https://github.com/openai/codex">Codex CLI</a> Accounts<br>
  Easily switch between accounts, monitor usage limits, and stay in control of your quota
</p>

## Features

- **Multi-Account Management** – Add and manage multiple Codex accounts in one place
- **Quick Switching** – Switch between accounts with a single click
- **Usage Monitoring** – View real-time usage for both 5-hour and weekly limits
- **Dual Login Mode** – OAuth authentication or import existing `auth.json` files

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)

### Build from Source

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lampese/codex-switcher.git
cd codex-switcher

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Run the Dashboard in a Browser

You can also serve the built dashboard over HTTP instead of opening the Tauri shell.

```bash
# Build the frontend and start the web server on 0.0.0.0:3210
pnpm lan
```

Optional environment variables:

- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_HOST` to override the bind host
- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_PORT` to override the port

The browser dashboard serves the same UI and backend actions through `/api/invoke/*`, which makes it usable over LAN, Tailscale, or a remote host tunnel when you expose the chosen port safely.

## Disclaimer

This tool is designed **exclusively for individuals who personally own multiple OpenAI/ChatGPT accounts**. It is intended to help users manage their own accounts more conveniently.

**This tool is NOT intended for:**

## Versioning

Use the version bump helper to keep app versions in sync across Tauri, Cargo, and the frontend.

```bash
# Exact version
pnpm version:bump 0.2.1

# Semver bumps
pnpm version:patch
pnpm version:minor
pnpm version:major

# Prepare a release commit and tag
# This automatically runs the version bump first.
pnpm release patch

# Prepare and push a release
# This automatically runs the version bump first.
pnpm release patch -- --push
```
