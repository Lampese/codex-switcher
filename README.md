## Installation

### Download a Release

The easiest way to install Codex Switcher is from the latest GitHub release:

[Download the latest release](https://github.com/Lampese/codex-switcher/releases/latest)

Choose the file for your platform:

- **macOS Apple Silicon:** `Codex.Switcher_*_aarch64.dmg`
- **macOS Intel:** `Codex.Switcher_*_x64.dmg`
- **Windows (installer):** `Codex.Switcher_*_x64-setup.exe` or `Codex.Switcher_*_x64_en-US.msi`
- **Windows (portable):** `codex-switcher.exe` — single executable, no installation required
- **Linux Debian/Ubuntu:** `Codex.Switcher_*_amd64.deb`
- **Linux AppImage:** `Codex.Switcher_*_amd64.AppImage`
- **Linux RPM:** `Codex.Switcher-*-1.x86_64.rpm`

> **macOS:** current release builds are not Apple-notarized. If macOS says the
> app is damaged, move it to `/Applications` and remove the quarantine flag:
>
> ```bash
> sudo xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine "/Applications/Codex Switcher.app"
> open "/Applications/Codex Switcher.app"
> ```

### Windows Portable EXE

The Windows `codex-switcher.exe` is a **self-contained executable** — no installer, no runtime, no
registry entries. Just download and run:

1. Download `codex-switcher.exe` from the latest release
2. Place it anywhere you like (e.g. `Desktop` or `C:\Tools`)
3. Double-click to launch

All account data (tokens, settings) is stored in `%USERPROFILE%\.codex-switcher\` and
`%USERPROFILE%\.codex\auth.json` — completely separate from the executable file.

### Updating

To update to a newer version:

1. Right-click the Codex Switcher tray icon → **Quit**
2. Replace the old `codex-switcher.exe` with the new one
3. Launch the new executable

Your accounts and settings are preserved — no re-login needed.

### Auto Updates

Codex Switcher checks the latest GitHub release on startup. When a newer signed
update package is available, the app shows an update prompt and can install it
from inside the app.

### Build from Source

#### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18+)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Lampese/codex-switcher.git
cd codex-switcher

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run in development mode
pnpm tauri dev

# Build for production
pnpm tauri build
```

> **Windows:** the `pnpm tauri` script runs through a POSIX shell wrapper
> (`sh ./scripts/tauri.sh`) and will not work in PowerShell/CMD. Use the
> `tauri:win` script instead: `pnpm tauri:win dev` and `pnpm tauri:win build`.

The built application will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

### Run the Dashboard in a Browser

You can also serve the built dashboard over HTTP instead of opening the Tauri shell.

```bash
# Build the frontend and start the web server on 0.0.0.0:3210
pnpm lan
```

Optional environment variables:

- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_HOST` to override the bind host
- `CODEX_SWITCHER_WEB_PORT` to override the port

The browser dashboard serves the same UI and backend actions through `/api/invoke/*`, which makes it usable over LAN, Tailscale, or a remote host tunnel when you expose the chosen port safely.

## Usage and Reset Credits

Codex Switcher shows two kinds of account usage information:

- **Rate limits** – the account card shows the current 5-hour and weekly limit
  windows, remaining percentage, reset timing, credit balance, and subscription
  expiry when available.
- **Usage Stats** – ChatGPT OAuth accounts can expand the **Usage
  Stats** panel to view stats such as lifetime tokens,
  today, last 7 days, last 30 days, streaks, longest task, token activity,
  reasoning/activity insights, and most-used integrations. The active account
  opens this panel by default; other accounts keep it collapsed until needed.
- **Manual reset credits** – OAuth accounts with available reset credits show a
  compact badge next to the plan badge. It includes the available count and the
  closest expiry date, hides zero-count results, and turns amber within 10 days
  or red within 3 days of expiry.

The tray popup also includes compact active-account stats for today and
the last 7 days, while keeping the normal rate-limit refresh flow separate.

## Warm-Up

A warm-up sends one minimal request to an account so its current 5-hour usage
window starts counting — handy for activating a window before you need it.

- **Manual** – warm up a single or all accounts, from the main window or tray menu.
- **Automatic** – when enabled (per account or for all), the app warms an
  account each time its 5-hour window resets, as long as the weekly limit isn't
  exhausted.
- **Timed** – pick specific times of day (e.g. `08:00`, `13:00`, `18:00`) from
  the **Timed** control in the main window. At each time the app warms all
  accounts (skipping any whose weekly limit is exhausted), so you control when
  your 5-hour windows start instead of letting them drift.

Timed warm-up checks the schedule every 30 seconds, runs each configured minute
only once per day, and skips missed times if the machine was asleep instead of
warming accounts late.

On macOS you can keep the machine awake with the built-in `caffeinate` command,
which stops automatically when the app quits:

```bash
caffeinate -i -w "$(pgrep -x 'Codex Switcher')"
```

## Disclaimer

## Versioning

Use the version bump helper to keep app versions in sync across Tauri, Cargo, and the frontend.

```bash
# Exact version
pnpm version:bump 0.2.1

# Semver bumps
pnpm version:patch
pnpm version:minor
pnpm version:major

# Prepare a release commit and tag
# This automatically runs the version bump first.
pnpm release patch

# Prepare and push a release
# This automatically runs the version bump first.
pnpm release patch -- --push
```
